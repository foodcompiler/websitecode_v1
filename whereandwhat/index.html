            <h2 class="text-uppercase">SODA BOTTLE OPENER WALA, Khan Market</h2>
            <p>One visit was not enough to this place, thus went again as i missed a very delicious dish - Mutton Berry Pulao
              (how could i??). Ordered sandwich, cookies and pulao. The dishes were presented in a steel plate, quite different
              but not impressive. However food quality was great!</p>
            <div class="owl-carousel text-center">
              <div>
                <h3>BOMBAY RASTA MULTIGRAIN SANDWICH</h3>
                <img src="images/bombay_rasta_multigrain_sandwich_sodabottle.jpg">
                <p>
                  Served with chips and namkeen, and stuffed with fresh veggies, was great in taste. However the namkeen was not really over
                  the sandwich. The multigrain bread was crispy.
                </p>

                <h3>NAAN KHATAAI</h3>
                <img src="images/naan_khataai_sodabottle.jpg">
                <p>
                  Taking a bite of it will melt the cookie in your mouth. Perfectly sugar-ed and tasted good.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h3>MUTTON BERRY PULAO</h3>
                <img src="images/mutton_berry_pulao_sodabottle.jpg">
                <p>
                  Now what to write about it. This was an amazing pulao i ever had. Had cashewnuts, berries and boneless mutton pieces. Quality
                  of rice was very good and tasted heaven. The pulao when served, may look quite simple, however the moment
                  you take the spoon and dig inside, trust me, you will be lost. A single dish was ample for 2. Highly recommended.

                <h3>GINGER COOKIES</h3>
                <img src="images/ginger_cookies_sodabottle.jpg">
                <p>
                  Bit hard to eat, but the taste of ginger is surely worth. Ginger with a sweet flavor to be precise. Must eat.
                </p>

                <h3>CHOCOLATE SHAKE</h3>
                <img src="images/chocolate_shake_sodabottle.jpg">
                <p>
                  Shake tasted average. The content of chocolate inside was quite less.

            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>
              Upon entering you can see kitchen and bar to your left, clean and maintained. The wall contains some strict messages when
              you enter the cafe after kitchen area - No picking nose, No feet on chair, No talking to cashier and the very
              last - No Pata Mein Hoon Kaun....lol. If you would want to know the family behind this cafe, go straight after
              entering. The last wall contains a photo-gallery of all family members, youngest being Mr. Rustom and eldest
              was George V Mary. The cafe is full of parsi's funny quotes. Stewards were active and joyful. They all were
              dressed well.
            </p>
            <h3>LOCATION</h3>
            <p>
              Reaching from metro is easy because of Khan Market metro station (Violet line). Parking is little tough, until you are the
              back side of the market. Located in foodie bay of Khan Market, is not easily visible because of surrounding
              hoardings. Go to the last of middle lane heading to Prithiviraj market.
