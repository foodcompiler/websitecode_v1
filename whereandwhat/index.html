            <h2 class="text-uppercase">kebab gali, vasant kunj</h2>
            <p>
              Navratri was on, and being a non-veggie you look out for some really *delicious* veggie stuff, and then you land up at Kebab
              Gali! Wow, amazing. Checked in Sunday for lunch. Ordered starters, main course and some desserts.
            </p>
            <div class="owl-carousel text-center">
              <div>
                <h3>DAHI KEBAB</h3>
                <img src="images/dahi_kebab_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  So this dahi kebab was by far the best dahi kebab i had so far. The hung curd was perfect, and spiced as desired. Usually
                  deep fried items are little oily to eat, but not true for this Dahi Kebab. Each serving had 4 pieces of
                  Kebab. Highly recommended if you are Dahi Kebab lover. Presentation of these dish was great, surrounded
                  by long-cut capsicum on a cabbage slice, looked delicious and tasted well.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>SHIKAMPURI KABAB</h3>
                <img src="images/shikampuri_kebab_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  4 pieces in one serving, this kebab wasn't really that tasty as compared to others. Was served with sliced tomatoes. However,
                  the veggies inside were properly cooked but still it din't taste awesome. But this should be given a try
                  for sure.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>STUFFED MUSHROOM</h3>
                <img src="images/stuffed_mushroom_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  I am not at all a mushroom lover, and after having this dish i am now a mushroom hater. Personally i did not like this dish
                  at all. Was not able to eat a single piece even. Would not recommend this. The dish was presented with
                  a full onion cut into pieces put into center. You cannot even taste it, wondering why it was kept even.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>PANEER TIKKA</h3>
                <img src="images/paneer_tikka_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  Each serving had 6 pieces and was served in a moving 4 wheeler types tray (innovative presentation for sure), with a small
                  rose in the center with onion and capsicum. Paneer was really soft, and well prepared. Recommended dish
                  for sure.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>GALAUTI KEBAB PARATHA</h3>
                <img src="images/galauti_kebab_paratha_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  Highly recommended dish before even i start writing about it. Kebab was so well prepared and the paratha was properly cooked.
                  My mouth was full of water the moment i took the first bite of it. It tasted a little sweet to me, but
                  went good in the taste. Presentation was same as of Dahi Kebab, served on a cabbage slice and long-cut
                  capsicum.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>DAL MAKHANI</h3>
                <img src="images/dal_makhani_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  The buttery Dal Makhani was good in taste. Was served in a mini bucket, had good amount of Butter floating on top :) Quantity
                  was more than required, had a tummy full lunch.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>PANEER TIKKA MASALA</h3>
                <img src="images/paneer_tikka_masala_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  Quite big pieces of paneer, with an awesome taste. Highly recommended. Not really very spicy and not that *meetha* flavor
                  - perfectly balanced. Again, quantity was quite large. Served beautifully, and tasted far beyond delicious.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>MIRCHI PARATHA</h3>
                <img src="images/mirchi_paratha_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  If you look at the paratha, you will find hell lot of chilli pieces, but trust me you not find it that chilly. The seeds
                  are not being used in the preparation. So while eating it would taste little spicy but you will enjoy it.
                  Paratha was crispy to eat. Eating it with Paneer Tikka Masala was awesome. Must try.
                </p>

              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>CHEENI MAKHMALI PARATHA</h3>
                <img src="images/cheeni_paratha_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  We all might have ate this in home, paratha with sugar fillings. So this was not really a sweet. So would not recommend this.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>PHIRNI</h3>
                <img src="images/phirni_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  This tasted heaven, not very sweet and yet sweet. Highly recommended. Served with dry fruits.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>GULAB JAMUN</h3>
                <img src="images/gulab_jamun_kebab_gali.jpg">
                <p>
                  Tasted good and was microwaved perfectly, not very hot. The presentation was not really good, but the taste compensated it
                  :)
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>
              Apart from the food, there were some drinks on table which included Aam Panna, Lemonade, Chaach, Jaljeera. Jaljeera and Aam
              Panna was a true refresher for this summers. Beautifully presented in glass bottles. The place contains 20
              seats, with five 4 seater tables.
            </p>
            <h3>LOCATION</h3>
            <p>
              Located in Vasant Square Mall in the ground floor, this place is surely worth your tummy. If you are driving there is ample
              space of parking, right in front of the mall. Coming by metro would not be a good choice as the nearest metro
              would be Chattarpur (yellow line). But after getting down from Metro, if would take another 10-15 minutes to
              reach this place.

            <p>
              One visit was not enough to this place, thus went again as i missed a very delicious dish - Mutton Berry Pulao (how could
              i??). Ordered sandwich, cookies and pulao. The dishes were presented in a steel plate, quite different but
              not impressive. However food quality was great!

                <img src="images/bombay_rasta_multigrain_sandwich_sodabottle.jpg">
                <p>
                  Served with chips and namkeen, and stuffed with fresh veggies, was great in taste. However the namkeen was not really over
                  the sandwich. The multigrain bread was crispy.
                </p>
              </div>

                <p>
                  Taking a bite of it will melt the cookie in your mouth. Perfectly sugar-ed and tasted good.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>MUTTON BERRY PULAO</h3>
                <img src="images/mutton_berry_pulao_sodabottle.jpg">
                <p>
                  Now what to write about it. This was an amazing pulao i ever had. Had cashewnuts, berries and boneless mutton pieces. Quality
                  of rice was very good and tasted heaven. The pulao when served, may look quite simple, however the moment
                  you take the spoon and dig inside, trust me, you will be lost. A single dish was ample for 2. Highly recommended.

                <p>
                  Bit hard to eat, but the taste of ginger is surely worth. Ginger with a sweet flavor to be precise. Must eat.

              Upon entering you can see kitchen and bar to your left, clean and maintained. The wall contains some strict messages when
              you enter the cafe after kitchen area - No picking nose, No feet on chair, No talking to cashier and the very
              last - No Pata Mein Hoon Kaun....lol. If you would want to know the family behind this cafe, go straight after
              entering. The last wall contains a photo-gallery of all family members, youngest being Mr. Rustom and eldest
              was George V Mary. The cafe is full of parsi's funny quotes. Stewards were active and joyful. They all were
              dressed well.

            <h3>LOCATION</h3>
            <p>
              Reaching from metro is easy because of Khan Market metro station (Violet line). Parking is little tough, until you are the
              back side of the market. Located in foodie bay of Khan Market, is not easily visible because of surrounding
              hoardings. Go to the last of middle lane heading to Prithiviraj market.

            <p>What a treat to my taste buds, Big Chill - Cheers! Went out for a light dinner, and day could not end better
              than this, amazing. I always used to see a good waiting line whenever i pass by, but luckily got the seats
              with zero waiting time. The healthy-yet-delicious salad and the chicken sandwich were the star of the night.</p>

                <p>
                  The bread was perfect, and the melted chicken spread was perfect - Pure delight. Presented simply, every bite of the sandwich
                  melted like cheese balls in mouth. No sauce, no pepper required. One can finish it easily, and be left
                  craving for more. Highly recommended for sandwich lovers.

                <p>
                  As we all know, nutrition and delicious-ness are not really good friends, but this salad changed my perception. The fresh
                  lettuce, smoked tomatoes and the fresh chicken - was the highest level of awesomeness i tasted. Good for
                  health and tasty as well. Quantity was ample for two. Presentation was great - the thin cheese slides were
                  perfectly placed over the salad. Highly recommended for salad lovers.

            <p>
              After a long time, i ate something delicious, thank you big chill for this delight. Would love to visit again. There are
              2 outlets of Big Chill in Khan market (they have a cakery shop as well), i went to 68-A. Small but powerful
              outlet. (PS: By powerful i meant delicious ;). Ambience is great, well maintained, clean and hygienic. The
              walls were covered by the hollywood faces. Stewards don't have a dress code, so make sure you remember them
              by their face. Felt the place was little congested to sit. Highly recommended place to get the best for your
              taste buds.

            <h3>LOCATION</h3>
            <p>
              Located in the back side of the market, is easily reachable by both metro and own vehicle. Gate no: 4 Khan Market metro station
              (Violet line) takes you straight to the market. Parking is and always be a problem in Khan market, but have
              been here so many times that got used to it lol.

                  Truly a healthy start of the day! A shake made of yoghurt and fruits. Shake was thick enough and delicious. Fruits were properly
                  blend, none came as a solid bite in mouth. Felt it was little cold initially, that stopped to drink it
                  instantly.

                  very chocolaty. Taste was very good, and the muffin was fresh.

            <p>
              Jam, sauce, butter, straws, pepper, sugar were present on every table. The floor had those black and white board type styling,
              which was very well maintained. The red couches were little uncomfortable, for long-legged people ;) Ambience
              was very maintained, and the stewards very active in taking feedback. Known for a good breakfast, this place
              should definitely be tried.

            <h3>LOCATION</h3>
            <p>
              This is located in the India Habitat Center, but not inside Eatopia. To come by metro, you can either get down at Khan Market
              (Violet line) or Jor Bagh (Yellow line), and take an auto. Roughly same distance from both the metro stations.
              If you are driving, there is an ample and free underground parking available.
